sdesc: "Advanced PNG (Portable Network Graphics) optimizer"
ldesc: "A PNG optimizer that recompresses the image files to a smaller size.
It losslessly reduces the bit depth, the color type and the color
palette of the image, runs a suite of compression methods and
strategies, and selects the compression parameters that yield the
smallest output file. It also recognizes several external file formats
like BMP, GIF, TIFF and PNM (PBM, PGM, PPM)."
